## Why I made this
I helped my family digitize some old videos. The videos are in Russian. I want both sides of my family to understand the videos, so I'm writing subtitles.

### I'm bilingual, I'm fluent in Russian and English.

The YouTube Russian subtitle generator is pretty good. Speeds up the process pretty well. But their editor sucks. It's not very intuitive. I wanted to be able to play just the clip I was working on, but the mouse kept on jumping around and it wouldn't play at the timestamp.

### So... I made an app to help me with the subtitle editing process!

It already works way better than the built-in YouTube subtitle editor, in my opinion. There's a couple more features I'd like to add for it to work smoothly. My app currently doesn't have an _undo_ or _preview_ button. Either way, the editing process is smoother than before.

**The thing I LOVE about my app** is that when I click play on one of the subtitle elements, it only plays the clip between _start_ and _end_ timestamps of the subtitle. I love that I can just focus on editing one section at a time.

**The thing I hate about the YouTube subtitle editor** is that editing and scrolling through the subtitles is extremely tedious, the main function of their app is horrendously annoying.

### I feel great knowing that I made an app in just a few days that works well :)
