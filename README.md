## Why I made this
I helped my family digitize some old videos. The videos are in Russian. I want both sides of my family to understand the videos, so I'm writing subtitles.

### I'm bilingual, I'm fluent in Russian and English.

The YouTube Russian subtitle generator works well and speeds up the translation process. Unfortunately, their subtitle editor is not intuitive at this time. I wanted to play just the clip I was working on, but the mouse kept on jumping around and wouldn't replay at the timestamp. It's important for me to be able to replay a section in case I missed a few words the first time.

So... I made an app to help me with the subtitle editing process!

### I feel great knowing that I made an app in just a few days that works well :)
